# neural_tic_tac_toe
Play a game of Tic Tac Toe against a neural network!

GETTING STARTED

As a prerequisite, Git must be installed on your system. 

To launch the game, git clone the current repository. 
Go to the new folder called neural_tic_tac_toe, and type 'npm install'. Then type 'npm start'.

If all goes well, a browser tab with the game will open!

USING THE SETTINGS TAB

Start playing by clicking anywhere on the 3x3 grid. You may change the training level of the network in the Settings tab, by entering a new value into the 'Training Epochs' field. The same game or a new one may be played after causing the network to retrain due to the setting change.
Once a settings change is made, return to the Game tab. Once in the Game tab, click New Game to clear the board, or keep playing to completion.
